## Overview

Week two of my journey started the journey of knowledge and the development of my mindset in that is optimal becoming a software craftsman. 

## Kata

This week I did my first two kata’s. A kata is a practice done widely in the martial art’s community. It is the repetition of small and organized movements in order to ingrain the motion for self-defense and muscle memory. In my application, it is simple problems that need to be solved using simple coding to complete written test(using the TDD outline as the reference in last week’s overview).  This week’s kata was to solve the following: 1.) Make a positive, negative, and zero a negative number. 2.) Make an average of an array of numbers. This basic practice showed me how to think and began to open my eyes in the mindset that opens the doors for learning and optimal performance. 

## Learning

In addition over this week, I began to learn and develop my skill into Javascript. Though I still at the small end of the spectrum. I feel confident in the connections I am developing in my mind and my ability.

## Struggle

Lastly, this week’s log comes over a two week period. I had a stressful and overloaded previous week that delayed all learning and opportunity. What I take from this is first to take better care of myself in order to learn and function at the highest level; and two, develop a better system for time management in order to account for the times that become hectic in life. I take this as my main point in learning and will use it moving forward in my journey to becoming a software craftsman.
