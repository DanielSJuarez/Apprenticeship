## Intro
This week presented more forward progress. I began to learn to react, as well as started to read "Clean Code" by "which is an excellent read. Though I am at the beginning of each journey I feel as this will be a vital step in my forward progress.
## Good
This week was full of continued success. first, I feel as my success and understanding of Kata's continues to grow as I am about to graduate from 8 Ku to 7 Ku very shortly. I have a better fundamental understanding of how to solve the problem and what needs to solve. In addition, I am beginning to refactor my work more and more, as understand the usefulness of reusable functions and loops to reuse. Though a Kata is a small scope to base this off of, the fundamental understanding is there. Secondly, as I began to research React and JXT, this help solidify more understanding of HTML and how the visualization or programs begin to develop on top of the baseline code. 
## Bad
This week set back was a simple one, I can no access to the technology I need to study to my fullest potential over the week. Though I studied and towards the end of this week began to make headway. I still sold myself short of my fullest potential.
## Conclusion
As a review, my interest in the standard of becoming a software craftsman, not only just becoming one is turning into a focal point in my mind. With assistance from my mentor, I continue to grow up the scale of excellence and the measure in which I am to become my goal and will strive even more this week to Improve my skills and more importantly mindset of becoming a software craftsman.
