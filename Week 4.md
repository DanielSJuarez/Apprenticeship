## Overview

This overview shows the beginning of some real progress in my learning of Javascript. Though still a novice in many retrospects, I have begun to understand the surface and fundamentals of what I am learning. Now is the time to continue to learn and begin to implement what I have learned in order to cement the information for future use in my career,

## Success

This weekâ€™s success was the completion of the beginner's Javascript course from Treehouse. Which gave me some general knowledge along with the foundation for developing basic programs and interactions with the DOM and human interfacing. I feel that my understanding really expanded and though work still needs to be done. The thought process whether that be creating or refactoring my code is beginning to take shape in my mind. How to compartmentalize individual problems and how to incorporate that into the bigger picture, along with how a problem should be approached is my major win for this week. Lastly, a small win is that of time management. I felt as I was able to develop my time to incorporate work, learning and personal happiness. Though a lot of works needs to be done. I am heading in the right direction.

## Struggle

First the failing of my freecodeacademy goal. I was short of the goal. This was due to lack of understanding, and again lack of time management. This was caused by personal interference and major health issues that inhibited my progress and put me behind schedule. Though this was a loss, I learn the importance of self-preservation. This allows you to have the time and ability to do what needs to be done at work, and that of life. In addition to developing my priorities, and making sure that I hold to them. I have a tendency to push through the pain to get something done, but all this does is decrease the quality, quantity, and happiness in whatever aspects this is involved. I will tie all this together in improving my goals and ambitions for next week.

## Conclusion

In closing, this week was filled with wins and losses. I take away this, that I can achieve my goal of being a software craftsman. Though focus and dedication, I can make this dream become a reality.
