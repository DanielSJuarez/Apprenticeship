## Overview

This week of practice to become a software craftsman, posed many questions for my understanding of the concepts I have begun to learn over the last few weeks. In all, I believe I simply and continue to develop my mindset on how to become a professional in the craftsman industry. From here I hope to expand upon my knowledge using the mentors and resources set forth to myself. 

## Success

This week I believe I have begun to feel comfortable in the environment of becoming a software craftsman. My outlook on goal orientation, TDD, and other concepts have begun to become more habit each day. This, in turn, leads to my continuous development and improvement each day and adds continuous excitement and intrigue each day.

## Struggle

I felt as I have hit a little bit of a speed bump in my understanding of how to move forward. Though I have been learning more advanced concepts, I feel my understanding of “Why” is lacking at this moment. This is caused by my lack of momentum, not only in that I have not had a chance to work with my mentor and only self-training, but that also of my self-improvement getting in the way of completely understanding each concept thoroughly. I need to continue to learn until I have learned and mastered each concept for my own success. 

## Conclusion

In closing, I am ready to take my next steps. To complete my understanding, and to begin to dive into the real application and “learning through experience” I strive to make this week more successful than the last and to take myself in the next level of becoming a software craftsman.
