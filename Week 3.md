Overview

    This update has a positive and negative connotation to it. I had success in progress and mindset, but a loss in my mental focus due to a personal circumstance which will be expanded upon below.

Sucess

    This week's best takeaway again starts with my development in kata performance. Though on one side of the coin. Only one of the two required kata’s was able to be completed, due to delay in communication with my mentor. On the positive side, of which I am very proud. I was able to develop a successful solution and improve upon my solution throughout the week for my other kata. This kaka was to repeat multiple strings of different lengths. Though a small victory, it is a victory indeed and shows my ability to learn and that I have indeed learned and retained the information. Moving forward I look to continue my success and ability to find solutions on my own. In addition, my knowledge has my expanded using the tools provided to me to use(I.e. Treehouse, and Free Code Camp). Writing concepts as “document.write", and alerts have been explained and understood to the point that I feel very comfortable in their uses. Overall if feel through my productivity should have been better, I count this as a victory in my journey.

Struggles

    This week had a negative tone as well. The first struggle was that this week marked the two year anniversary of my dad’s death. This significantly distracted my focus on all aspects of life, including my learning. Though personal issues should be separated from professional duties, this was an exception and heavily influenced my perform this week. Secondly if have determined that my current job, if a major thorn in my side for success and energy to learn. I must develop a better plan in the upcoming weeks if a want to obtain the level of knowledge I strive for in the timeframe that I want it. Again time and mind management are going to be very important moving forward in my life. 

Conclusion

    Overall this week was a success, and though there were struggles and blockades. I feel that I have developed as a man, and come to an understanding of how I am to go moving forward. “You miss 100% of the shots you do not take% - Wayne Gretzky. This is being taken to hear by myself and will be used moving forward for obtaining my success.
