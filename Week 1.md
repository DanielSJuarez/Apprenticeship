This is the start of a journey to obtain excellence in myself and a career. This is the overview of my first week following the path to becoming a software craftsman. Follow the development and knowledge obtained on my journey.

## The overview
I began this week with a start-up sprint review/introduction. During this time I obtained more insight into the direction and path I was to take and the expectation required for success. I plan on taking this on with full strength and intensity, but only as quickly as I can achieve excellence in my knowledge and craft. We reviewed the basics of software processing and the break down in human and system interaction. 

## Reading
This week's assignment was to read "The Clean Coder" by Robert C Martin. This is an excellent read that I recommend. In this read the main points that jump out to me are as such:
          - The importance of self-confidence, and to have pride in one's work. Not in that your work is better than others, but that of responsibility, and self-preservation. The key to becoming a software profession is not only that you do great work, but have an understanding of oneself, and your abilities. To communicate with excellence and to work with effective time management. 
          - Test Driven Development(TDD)This concept is in my mind the superior accomplishment to development of the outdated "waterfall" technique. Though this has its place and time, TDD offers security in code and ensures that you have an understanding of how to write dynamically and with the ability to change. TDD is the concept of writing simples pass/fail test that will prove your code is functional and does so in short calculated distances for small amounts of code. This in turns allows you to adjust on the go with what you have written. I believe this is not only a great concept in development but that of life as well. Testing your knowledge and ability in short turnarounds,  you have a full understanding of your work or concepts that you are learning. I will be applying this concept of TDD to my work as a software craftsman and my everyday life.
          - Communication is key. Saying no, and yes are skills that many professionals have lost. The "go with the flow" technique is prevalent and does not allow for effective communication and expectation. Specifically in the business realm. The importance of a complete understanding of one's team, organizations, customer, and the client is paramount and this read offers some very sound advice from one of the industries greats.

## Mac 
This week I purchased my first Mac computer to aid in my endeavors of becoming a software craftsman. Though I am learning the system and unlearning the years of Microsoft ingrained in my processing. My Mac Book Pro offers the perfect platform and has the perfect capabilities to launch myself in my career and I fully intend to use it to its fullest capacity.

## Website
This week I created my very first website and juarezdaniel.com. Of course, it is published in the classic first text. I plan on creating a profile and site that will eventually show off myself, and my capabilities. Look forward to updates soon as I create my online presence and hope to provide insight on myself to the world. 

## Conclusion
At the end of the beginning of my journey to become a software craftsman, I see that my eyes have been opened into a world that I have much to learn and develop. I am filled with excitement and am eagerly awaiting to learn all there is to learn. In turn, I will pass down the knowledge I learn to my pupil when the time is appropriate. Where it be my first introduction in the becoming a software craftsman, "The Clean Coder", or my very first website. This is the beginnings of my knowledge development. My take away is to strive for excellence conscientiously. Just striving for excellence will provide improvement, but excellence in a direction can unlock the means for perfection, in coding and life. I will take this to heart along with TDD as I hope to learn new skills and knowledge on my path of becoming a professional software craftsman.
